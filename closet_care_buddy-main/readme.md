This application was created for the class LMC 8803 GM1 AI 4 DM taught by Brian Magerko and Manoj Deshpande at Georgia Tech. The project goal is to support individuals during closet decluttering by:  
1. **Describing Clothing Items**: Using AI to generate detailed captions for clothing items under consideration.  
2. **Providing Outfit Inspiration**: Generating AI-based outfit inspiration ideas to encourage creative reuse of clothing.
